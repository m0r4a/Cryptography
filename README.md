# My Cryptography class and Python

[ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ VersiÃ³n en EspaÃ±ol](README_es.md)

## Introduction

This project was made for my cryptography class at university. The exams were several hours long on weekends, tedious and boring. However, we had the option to take the exams through code, so I decided to take that path.


## Objective

The main objective of this project was simply to have an active project to continue programming in Python.


## Content

This project features 2 encryption methods and a mathematical topic related to cryptography.

<summary>AFFINE encryption method</summary>

# AFFINE Encryption and Decryption

The AFFINE encryption method is the first encryption method I had to learn for my cryptography class. I like to think of it in the following way:

## Step 1: Variables

First, we have the variables. Specifically, for the purpose of the course, we use 5 variables:

- n: the alphabet size
- a: the first part of the encryption key
- b: the second part of the encryption key
- bs: the block size
- N: the alphabet size ** the block size used for the modulo operation if we're using higher block sizes than 1

In addition to, of course, the string we want to encrypt.

## Step 2: Letters to Numbers

With the variables defined, the next step in the encryption methods of my first cryptography exam is to convert the letters or text string into numbers to operate on them.

## Encryption

### Step 3: Encryption

The encryption process for the AFFINE cipher is as follows:

P = plaintext
E = encrypted text

E = a * P + b (mod N)

## Decryption

### Step 3: Decryption

Now, having our encrypted numbers, we want to perform the same procedure we used for encryption but in reverse. For this, we need to find the inverse of a.

### Step 3.1: Inverse of a

The process of obtaining the inverse of a is somewhat... simple?

It involves using an extended version of the Euclidean algorithm to find the quotients of the Greatest Common Divisor. With the results, we create a table somewhat like this:

|           |           | quotient 1 | quotient 2 | quotient 3 | quotient 4 |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
|     0     |     1     |            |            |            |            |   
|     1     |     0     |            |            |            |            |

And by performing the process: quotient 1 * a_arr[i - 1] + a_arr[i - 2] where a_arr is the first row, we obtain the inverse of a.

### Step 3.2: Decryption

The decryption process for the AFFINE cipher is as follows:

P = plaintext
E = encrypted text

P = a^-1 * (E - b) (mod N)

## Step 4: Numbers to Letters

Finally, having our transformed numbers, we can convert them back into text, obtaining our desired text.

# Functions

## Letter to Number

This function transforms letters into numbers based on the Hill encryption method.

### Parameters:

- `alphabet_size` (*int*): The size of the alphabet, i.e., the number of characters in the alphabet. This parameter is crucial for calculating the base for converting characters into their corresponding numeric values.

- `block_size` (*int*): The size of each block or "level" in the graph. This parameter determines how the input string is divided into blocks for processing.

- `string` (*str*): The string to be converted into numbers. It's the input data that needs to undergo the transformation.

### Return Value:

The function returns a list of integers representing the numeric values obtained from the letters in the input string.

### Functionality:

- **Divide the String into Blocks**: The input string is divided into blocks of the specified size using list comprehension. Each block represents a segment of the input data.

- **Convert Characters to Numeric Values**: For each block, the function iterates through the characters in reverse order (from right to left). Inside this loop, it calls the `char_to_number` function to convert each character into its corresponding numeric value based on the alphabet size.

- **Calculate Decimal Values**: It calculates the decimal value of each block using the formula: `decimal_value += numeric_value * (alphabet_size ** i)`, where `i` represents the position of the character in the block.

- **Collect Decimal Values**: Finally, it appends the decimal value of each block to a list and returns this list of decimal values as the output.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example Usage
result = letter_to_number(alphabet_size=26, block_size=2, string="HELLOZ")
print(result)
```
#### Output: [186, 297, 389]

### Return Value:

The function returns the letters obtained from the input numbers.

### Functionality:

- **Prepare Decimal Values**: It ensures that the input `decimal_values` are in the correct format (a flat list of numbers).
- **Convert Numbers to Letters**: For each number in the input, it converts it into a string of letters based on the alphabet size and block size.

### Example Usage:

```python

<summary>HILL encryption method</summary>

# HILL Encryption and Decryption

The HILL encryption method is another encryption technique that I learned in my cryptography class. Here's how it works:

## Step 1: Variables

Similar to the AFFINE method, the HILL method also requires certain variables:

- n: the size of the alphabet
- m: the plaintext string
- matrix: the encryption key matrix

Some specific variables for this "project" are:

- matrix_size: The size of matrix you will be using
- block_size: A very straightforward variable 
- N: n ^ block_size, this is going to be the value of every mod operation 

## Step 2: Letters to Numbers

As with the AFFINE method, we need to convert the letters or the text string into numbers to operate on them.

## Encryption

### Step 3: Encryption

The encryption process for the HILL cipher involves matrix multiplication:

Being:
- C: Encrypted matrix
- P: Plain-text matrix

C = (P * K) mod n

## Decryption

### Step 3: Decryption

Similarly, the decryption process for the HILL cipher also involves matrix multiplication:

Being:
- C: Encrypted matrix
- P: Decrypted matrix

P = (C * K^-1) mod n

Where K^-1 is the inverse of the key matrix K.

## Step 4: Numbers to Letters

Finally, after decryption, we can convert the numerical results back into letters to obtain the plaintext.

<summary>Linear Congruences</summary>

# Linear Congruence Resolution using Chinese Remainder Theorem

The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is a fundamental result in number theory, particularly useful in solving systems of linear congruences. Let's understand how it works:

## Introduction

When faced with a system of congruences of the form:

x â‰¡ a_1 (mod m_1)
x â‰¡ a_2 (mod m_2)
...
x â‰¡ a_n (mod m_n)

Where `a_i` and `m_i` are integers, the Chinese Remainder Theorem provides a method to find a solution `x` that satisfies all the congruences simultaneously.

## Method

Given a system of congruences, the CRT proceeds as follows:

1. **Initialization**: We start with congruences of the form `x â‰¡ a_1 (mod m_1)` and `x â‰¡ a_2 (mod m_2)`.
2. **Solution of Two Congruences**: If we have two congruences, we can find the solution for `x`.
3. **Extension to Three Congruences**: If we have three congruences, we extend the solution by finding `x` that satisfies all three congruences.
4. **Generalization to N Congruences**: The process can be extended to any number of congruences.
5. **Final Solution**: The final solution is obtained by taking the result modulo the product of the moduli of all congruences.

## Example

Consider the following system of congruences:

x â‰¡ 2 (mod 3)
x â‰¡ 3 (mod 7)
x â‰¡ 4 (mod 16)

Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can solve this system and obtain the value of `x` that satisfies all three congruences.

The value of `x` satisfying all three congruences is `164`.

This illustrates how the Chinese Remainder Theorem can efficiently solve systems of congruences, a fundamental technique in number theory and cryptography.

## Note 

I relied entirely on the sympy library to do the sequence resolution due to lack of time, however, if I decide to take this project further, everything will eventually be programmed manually.

## Learning, Challenges, and Project Abandonment

### Cryptography

In terms of practical, useful, or applicable cryptography, I really didn't learn much. I only delved deeply into these two encryption methods from a mathematical, non-practical standpoint.

### Python

I learned quite a bit for Python. I believe my level as a "programmer" increased. I learned to use docstrings, to create a "decent" README.md, I used argparse quite a bit, and I learned a bit about the numpy library, etc.


### Challenges

The biggest challenge was the poor future planning of the project, as reflected in the .old folder, which contained past versions of this project before doing a full rework. Now I'll have to consider project planning much more, as the further "to the left" an error is in the development of a project, the easier it will be to correct.

### Project Abandonment

In the end, I abandoned this project because there was no incentive to continue working on it. Ultimately, the requirements for the exams were changed indiscriminately, and I wasn't allowed to take the exams entirely through code. Without being able to do them in that way, it no longer made sense or had a reason to spend so many hours of my time programming this project.


## Conclusion

After this project my Python skills felt fresh again, learned a bit of cryptography, and realized the importance of planning in a project. Although I leave it here as an abandoned project, I am satisfied with the result and with everything I learned in the process.
