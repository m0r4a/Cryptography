# My Cryptography class and Python

[ðŸ‡² VersiÃ³n en EspaÃ±ol](README_es.md)

## Introduction

This project was made for my cryptography class at university. The exams were several hours long on weekends, tedious and boring. However, we had the option to take the exams through code, so I decided to take that path.


## Objective

The main objective of this project was simply to have an active project to continue programming in Python.


## Content

This project features 2 encryption methods and a mathematical topic related to cryptography.

## Learning, Challenges, and Project Abandonment

### Cryptography

In terms of practical, useful, or applicable cryptography, I really didn't learn much. I only delved deeply into these two encryption methods from a mathematical, non-practical standpoint.

### Python

I learned quite a bit for Python. I believe my level as a "programmer" increased. I learned to use docstrings, to create a "decent" README.md, I used argparse quite a bit, and I learned a bit about the numpy library, etc.


### Challenges

The biggest challenge was the poor future planning of the project, as reflected in the .old folder, which contained past versions of this project before doing a full rework. Now I'll have to consider project planning much more, as the further "to the left" an error is in the development of a project, the easier it will be to correct.

### Project Abandonment

In the end, I abandoned this project because there was no incentive to continue working on it. Ultimately, the requirements for the exams were changed indiscriminately, and I wasn't allowed to take the exams entirely through code. Without being able to do them in that way, it no longer made sense or had a reason to spend so many hours of my time programming this project.


## Conclusion

After this project my Python skills felt fresh again, learned a bit of cryptography, and realized the importance of planning in a project. Although I leave it here as an abandoned project, I am satisfied with the result and with everything I learned in the process.
